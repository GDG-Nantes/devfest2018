## Quelques mots sur notre sponsor Vente-Priv√©e

At vpTech, we love people who love IT. Vente-Privee knows that you have to innovate in order to be a pioneer in ecommerce, and technology contributes to quality.

In 2016, we took our IT strategy to another level by rolling out a new product organization.
Each product is a start-up, based within the company, where employees can work on it independently.
We now support a team, not a project.
We trust employees to make the right choices. As a result, we use a wide variety of languages, systems, and tools (e.g., React, C#, Haskell, Python, Cassandra, Couchbase, MongoDB, and Kubernetes).

If you're human, you have to do your job well, and IT can deliver the solutions to help you do so.

Our R&D department, composed of Lab 42 and Lab Epitech, is full of talented students from these two well-known IT schools, both of which offer internships in our company. Fresh blood, fresh ideas and the power to be disruptive!

We are based in several cities, Paris (Saint-Denis), Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lyon, Nantes. The happiness of our employees is our priority.
Today, we have over 500 IT employees working on an array of projects. Bringing real passion to their work, they have developed reliable and innovative solutions for web tools.

We love to say, 'It's not you who comes to us but we who come to you.'
Join us.
